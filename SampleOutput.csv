I’d give it 5 stars...but,"Here’s what I like:This sucker will pump a lot material in short order.  During my springtime “weed blitzkreig” it cut my spray time in half.  I spray 50 gallons in my yard a year.  It’s a time saver.The high pressure setting makes for a much finer mist than my existing backpack sprayer.  The bonus is that my beer doesn’t go flat while pumping the snot out of a manual pump.  This will save me $20 a year in thrown out, flat beer.It’s also nice having my left hand free to do whatever: I.E. talk on the phone, eat Girl Scout cookies...or whatever.I like how I can buy separate tanks for for the various stuff I spray.  I no longer have to worry about getting my existing sprayer squeaky clean, or having to use multiple sprayers.Battery life is excellent.  I used an HD12.0 battery with 3 bars on the charge guage.  After 12 gallons of material, it still had 3 bars.It uses the same Milwaukee fuel batteries that the rest of my tools do (and I have a lot of them).  This is a big plus.What I don’t like:This sprayer won’t use all of the liquid in the tank.  There’s always some left in there.  If you do some Elvis Presley hip moves followed by the Macarena, it will help.  Just do it where your neighbors can’t see you.  Leaning back and to the left helps suck some additional material out, but no matter what I did, there was always a quart or two left in the tank that couldn’t be pumped out.  I thought about trying some Shakira moves, but I’m too old for that stuff.Your best bet is having a clean and labeled gallon jug to pour the leftover material into, and save it for the next time.  The “drain valve” sucks.  I had the best luck pouring out the excess material through the top, and using a funnel placed inside a gallon jug.Hopefully Milwaukee will come out with a tank that fixes this problem. This is the only real bad part of this tool.This sucker is expensive.  If you don’t spray much, it’s a waste of money unless you are trying to collect every fuel tool known to man.  He who dies with the most tools....wins!This baby is heavy.  It’s easily 10 pounds heavier than my existing sprayer.  Throw 4 gallons in it, and you will be lugging 40 plus pounds around on your back.  It’s not a huge problem if you have a good back.  The straps are wide, and it is very comfortable to wear.Make sure you keep the tank clean and don’t let any product spill when you are refilling it.  There are electrical contacts on the tank and on the base.  Some of the stuff we spray is caustic and will corrode most metals.  Keep the electrical contacts clean and dry.All in all, I think it is a good buy (not a great buy).  I don’t feel any remorse and I will happily keep using it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2020"
Don’t buy this product,"This is an exceptional idea. Unfortunately it quit working the first spray. Tried a new battery, not the problem. It sprayed for one gallon and the. Shuts down.I took it to the services center and Milwaukee didn’t want to pay for shipping because this is a sprayer and might have harmful chemicals.Had to argue with the services center to get them to keep it to look at it.Still haven’t gotten it back yet. I would not recommend buying this product, it is highly unreliable and not fully backed by Milwaukee.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2020"
Disappointed but willing to try again,"Great overall idea... maybe I got a lemon of a unit, trying to resolve that with the seller right now. Worked for about 3 gallons I used for watering a seeded area where no water was available. Went out the next day to water and the sprayer wasn’t working. Trigger wasn’t sending the message to the pump overall disappointed and would like a replacement unit for another try. When it worked it worked great. But as we speak right now it’s 300$ out the door and not able to do what it was purchased for. Overall love Milwaukee but 2 products from them have turned me maybe into another company’s tools. Well see how this plays out",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2020"
3 gallon not 4 gallon sprayer,"Great product, spray is pretty impressive. The biggest downside is when you are down to about a gallon left the pump has trouble building pressure. Major design flaw. Might as well label this as a 3 gallon sprayer not a 4. You can dance around to try and get it to work or I found turning the pressure all the way down for the last gallon helps but in the end you shouldn’t have to do this for how much this thing costs. The only reason I kept it was the convenience of being able to use my Milwaukee tool batteries. Milwaukee fix the issue!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020"
New. Defective tank out of box but no warranty!,"Sold as new and appeared new in package. Leaked directly through tank bottom through obvious manufacturing defect in plastic. Not detectable until partially filled. See pic. Not usable.  Can’t have poison running down my back.  (Have come to learn same problem with units all about nation.)Though new Milwaukee would not warranty insisting NO Amazon dealer is an authorized vendor.  I had presented to Dallas Milwaukee Service Ctr well within warranty period and discussed with all three front personnel inc manager w my recpt in hand.  They sent me away without recourse.I really did appreciate Vera Tools, w some delay, backing their sale by accepting return even after 1 mo from sale. I really had NO OPTION left. Vera authorized full refund.Seems that Milwaukee may be running two sale channels, ie 'authorized' and all the rest! Buyer beware!  Seller seemed totally in dark by Milwaukee's position.So 1 star for product with really poor quality control but 5 for seller backing their sale.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2021"

"This tank will leak all over you, Beware","I own a lot of Milwaukee tools and have always been pleased with their quality, however this tool is the exception. Upon first use the bottom of the tank (at the seam) leaked pesticides all over my back, no way to fix it and of course milwaukee wants the tank sent in to warranty.

"2 separate orders, same exact issue","We originally placed an order for this tool the first week of April.  The day after we received it we opened the box and took the plastic covering off to fill the tank up with water.  Immediately water began to pour out of the bottom of the tank due to a large crack where the black plastic support is screwed into the bottom.  This plastic is quite thick so to see a crack that long seemed unusual.  We filed for a replacement and waited 5 more days for that delivery only to open this one the day we received it, unwrap it and go to fill it up with water and discover THE SAME EXACT ISSUE of a large crack in the bottom of the tank of the second tool.  This makes me question where the seller is getting their product.  Do better and inspect your products before sending them out to your buyers.  This has been absolutely ridiculous.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2022"

tank leaks,"I have all the Milwaukee M18 products and thought this would be a good fit. The tank leaks very badly and you lose a large amount of solution along with it also dripping all over your backside. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product, it has a serious design flaw.

"Tank leaked at base, cracked or otherwise defective tank.",Liked everything about the tool but water started running out at the base almost as fast as I could fill it. Would not pump a drop though pump was operating?? Thought it was the drain cap but kept coming after I tightened it up.

great idea but one major flaw in the program,"We do vineyard work, gardening and forestry so this looks like a great idea for versatility and efficiency, plus if you have more of the tools with batteries that helps too.We kept mixing common farm chemicals and fertilizers and the units just kept stopping to pump.The problem is that in the manual it nowhere shows anything about how to remove the screen on the pump intake, and anybody who does spraying knows this is one of the most important operational features.The screen is inside the tank and needs to be twisted to unseat it for cleaning which may be very often because it is too tight for the pump intake and plugs easily.When you call to find out what the problem is you get argued with that you are using the wrong materials.So please rewrite the manual with this very essential information.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2020"
Finally got a chance to use it and it didn’t work,"I thought maybe the tight seal wouldn’t allow the pump to prime. Not the case. Thought that there was a seal on the new packaging blocking something.  It the case. It just wouldn’t work!  To top it off my return window closed a month after I got it when I finally got the chance to use it.  UPDATE. Got it working. Something was lodged behind the filter at the base of the tank, like a piece of stray plastic. Go to use it and it’s like the thing has prostate problems. Your money is better spent on two back pack pump sprayers. I like Milwaukee my company spend 100s of thousands on their tools each year but this is not a good product.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022"

Leaks like crazy,"*********Everything everyone else said. It leaked bad, can’t get out the last gallon. But worst for me is that you can’t really spot spray with it. All my other brand battery powered sprayers you can just squeeze the handle/leaver to spray and it will instantly spray, this one has to spin a motor on the base a few times to get enough pressure built up for it to spray some product, so by the time this one has spun the base and built up pressure to spray your holding down the sprayer handle like 3 or 4 times longer just to spray a weed, then when it does spray it SPRAYS, so you way over spray if your just trying to spot spray weeds. But if your only using for a constant spray and not needing to spot spray weeds (specially need to be careful with a “round up” spray so it dosnt over spray into the grass or your shoes/boots.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2022"
