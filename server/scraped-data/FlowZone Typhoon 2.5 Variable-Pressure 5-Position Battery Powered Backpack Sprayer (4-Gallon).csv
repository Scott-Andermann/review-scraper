You want a powerful sprayer this is it.,"You want a powerful sprayer this is it. I've owned the typhoon 2.0 this is a huge upgrade. New straps, new hose, new gun, its wonderful product. I own a pest control company and this makes my job so much easier. Also flow zone has great customer service. If you have a issue they fix it right away. Can't go wrong with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2022"
Awesome,Love it. I do a lot of spraying for my lawn customers .. this makes the job much faster compared to hand pumping.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021"
Top notch product,"I was nervous about spending the money on this sprayer. It’s expensive, but in my opinion it’s worth it. From spraying pre-emergent for my lawn, weed killers at my farm, or even using distilled water in it to rinse off my truck after washing, this thing has made my life so much easier. It does take some getting used to though. I used an entire 4 gallons on only half of my yard when using pre-emergent when my mixture was for my whole yard. That was ignorance on my part not knowing the gallons per 1000ft2. If you can afford it, it’s the best there is in my opinion.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2021"
Best Sprayer I have Ever Owned!,"I order the Typhoon V2 with variable pressure control.  It has been outstanding.  I have sprayed my driveway twice,  my entire outside of my house, my sidewalks and patio.  It still has three bars left on the battery.  I purchased a cart and a 20ft hose extension from another company and I had an issue with the cart and the backpack matching up.  I called FlowZone customer service and they sent  me the part to fix the problem at no charge right away.  Excellent customer service.  I even was able to spray mildew on my roof (about 26 feet up).  I love the variable pressure control.  Excellent design and if needed all parts are easily accessible.  Great product!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020"

Best sprayer we have owned,Best sprayer we have ever owned. It has great pressure and seems to spread more product then the former pump back sprayer we used to have. Easily reaches 6-8 feet away.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2020"

Needs better shoulder and chest harness,Great sprayer. Shoulder strap and harness could be better designed.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020"

"Great tool, no regrets so far. I had to find other source to order though..","This can easily empty out the entirety of it's tank in 10-15 minutes of spraying at full power. Despite shipping with the smaller battery this leaves you with a considerable amount of useful life in one charge to tackle large areas of your yard.Persons who deal with a bigger yard than mine ought to consider the 9 gallon version that is on wheels.I ran 10 gallons through the typhoon 2.5 and it still has a lot of battery left before I need to plug it in again.Straps on this are definitely well thought out, and padding is nice, I hear it's extra padded over the old one.I have plenty of reach with the stream shooting out 10-15 feet with various tips, full unrestricted output I estimate to be 20-25 feet.If you can call it that, there is no way this provides 60 psi or anything close to it. I would say this does about 20-30 psi at full output which is plenty.If you don't like the gun it has, I can't imagine who wouldn't, you can always swap it to a more traditional gun/wand that professional exterminators use.It does arrive partially discharged so charge it prior to use, charging took 40 minutes, easy peesy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2021"
Leaks,This is a great backpack sprayer for the money but it cracked somehow inside and now it has a leak that I cannot patch. I’ve owned this since June and my coworker also has a leak as well. We cannot find where it leaks from.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020"
