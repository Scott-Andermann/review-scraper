You want a powerful sprayer this is it.,"You want a powerful sprayer this is it. I've owned the typhoon 2.0 this is a huge upgrade. New straps, new hose, new gun, its wonderful product. I own a pest control company and this makes my job so much easier. Also flow zone has great customer service. If you have a issue they fix it right away. Can't go wrong with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on June 28, 2022"
Awesome,Love it. I do a lot of spraying for my lawn customers .. this makes the job much faster compared to hand pumping.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on December 26, 2021"
Top notch product,"I was nervous about spending the money on this sprayer. Itâ€™s expensive, but in my opinion itâ€™s worth it. From spraying pre-emergent for my lawn, weed killers at my farm, or even using distilled water in it to rinse off my truck after washing, this thing has made my life so much easier. It does take some getting used to though. I used an entire 4 gallons on only half of my yard when using pre-emergent when my mixture was for my whole yard. That was ignorance on my part not knowing the gallons per 1000ft2. If you can afford it, itâ€™s the best there is in my opinion.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 20, 2021"
Best Sprayer I have Ever Owned!,"I order the Typhoon V2 with variable pressure control.  It has been outstanding.  I have sprayed my driveway twice,  my entire outside of my house, my sidewalks and patio.  It still has three bars left on the battery.  I purchased a cart and a 20ft hose extension from another company and I had an issue with the cart and the backpack matching up.  I called FlowZone customer service and they sent  me the part to fix the problem at no charge right away.  Excellent customer service.  I even was able to spray mildew on my roof (about 26 feet up).  I love the variable pressure control.  Excellent design and if needed all parts are easily accessible.  Great product!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on April 18, 2020"
