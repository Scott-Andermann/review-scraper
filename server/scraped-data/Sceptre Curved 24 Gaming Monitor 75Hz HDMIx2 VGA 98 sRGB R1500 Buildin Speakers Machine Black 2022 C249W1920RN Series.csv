"clear, perfect  size, love  the curved screen","This monitor definitely gets 5 stars.  The size is great for a desk top, picture is clear ,and it has lots of options.  I never had a curved screen before and love the added dimension it brings.  For my daily home office work this is a great buy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on September 17, 2022"
"Great monitor, crap speakers","The monitor itself is great, which is why I have 2 of them, but the built in speakers are total crap. My tiny 20 dollar portable Bluetooth speaker is louder than this. I had to order some pc speakers just cuz these were so low. Other than that, everything else is great.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on September 9, 2022"
Great monitor but make sure you keep your external speakers...,"This is a great monitor, especially for the price!!!Do not rely on the internal speakers though. I turned everything up to 100%, to include the menu in the monitor. It is still too quiet to use. Ensure you keep your external speakers, you will need them.I still recommend this as a great monitor.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on September 10, 2022"
Beautiful curved screen and a lot of bang for the buck!,"This is my first curved computer monitor. It is immersive and do not want to go back to a flat panel. I had a ASUS monitor (non-curved) prior to this one. ASUS was a great monitor, but had it many years and started getting a little ""long in the tooth"". I am so glad I had upgraded to this Sceptre Curved 24"" Gaming Monitor. It is bright and sharp, with built in speakers. The speakers are not great, but I like having them built in, (It is one  of the things on my checklist when looking for a monitor.)better with than without. A good size monitor for me, not too big so I don't ruin my eyes. Easy to adjust settings. I would buy again from this brand. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on August 2, 2022"

"Sceptre Curved 24"" Gaming Monitor 75Hz",It shows good for the price. Nice gaming monitor for beginners or if you're on a budget.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on September 12, 2022"
General Purpose Monitor,"This is your everyday monitor, either for a home or office. for the price range it is a good choice. Here are some notes:  1. This unit can go to 75hz.  2. The stand for the unit is not the most stable one out there, try to keep it out of harm's way as best you can.  3.  The brightness on mine was set to high, the graphics appeared flush.  4. The unit comes with built in speakers if you need them in a pinch  5. A hdmi cable and hdmi to dvi adapter is included.Hope this helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on August 7, 2022"
