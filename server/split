Just buy it.","18":"Gran tarjeta de V\u00eddeo","19":"Bad Coil Whine","20":"Coil whine champ"},"Review":{"0":"Really cool looking Card but the coil whine is a no go. Even with headphones on, it sounds like a high pitch torture test. Just bad. Go ahead and buy one but good luck!","1":"Performance is top notch, a bit more than than the vanilla 3080, less than the 3080TI. Prices are going down slowly, but buying this Strix 3080 12gb at premium for me is a money we'll spent. I could have gone for the TI {Strix} bit it's way out of my budget (saving for an ROG monitor). Wanted to complete my ROG build. Still rocking my 10 yr old ROG XONAR Phoebus Solo sound card. Build quality is AAA since I'm using everything Asus. Games is not a problem for this card with a i9-11900 non-k cpu. Card is beast! Beast in power and thermals. There's coil whine when on full load, which is negligible for me as my old Gigabyte 1080ti Around is much louder. This will be my card for a very long time. Deducting stars as price is almost the same as a TI and performance gains are minimal from 3080 10gb and TI. Still a GREAT card to buy if you have the money .","2":"I initially gave this two stars after installing this card and running some of my GPU enabled apps and getting less performance than my GTX1070 on all of them.I was about to send it back when I decided to try some other things.Using some of my rendering software and various simulators, The card does work well in my system. I don't get the same numbers as the best benchmark scores, but I think that is more related to my system being Gen 3 PCIe and my CPU not being at the top of the heap.So after an initial disappointment, I decided to keep the card.","3":"I know it's worth quite a bit of money but man, trust me is it worth it. Any game I play I know I'll automatically get 300+ frames with high settings (ultra on some games) easily. Gone are the days of worry about fps spikes lol. Was reading some reviews of this card and some people were complaining about coil wine. Didn't even know what coil wine was until after I purchased the card and just wondering what other people thought of it. Admittedly it does have some coil wine but the only way I heard it was by launching a game, going to a practice room, setting all my fans (7) to \"quiet mode\" opening the side panel and carefully listening to the GPU. That is the only way I heard it. Unless you're PC is OPEN and you don't headphones or earphones then you might hear it but even then it really isn't that notable. I give this GPU a 10\/10.","4":"This is the highest end 12GB RTX 3080 you can get from Asus.  The first thing you need to know is that this thing is power hungry and will create more heat because of that. Something to note if you are upgrading from a lower end GPU. The dual bios switch comes set to performance mode which has an aggressive fan curve and will run cooler but louder.  The opposite if you switch to quiet mode.  This is more of an enthusiast's GPU and if you are looking for quieter and cooler then I'd recommend the Tuf series.  It actually doesn't run very hot, it just sheds it's heat well, so you'll want be aware of that. With a few tweaks it's possible to get your fps into the realm of 3080ti and 3090 land. It's rigid enough that I don't notice any sagging in my rig.  Coil whine?  None here. Luck of the draw?  Maybe. But having a higher end PSU (you get what you pay for) and not daisy chaining the PCIE cables does help.","5":"So far so good","6":"Did worse than a rx 550, it made no sense.","7":"Having thoroughly tested this Asus RTX 3080 12G card, I must say that it is my best card among the RTX 3080 12G when compared to the MSI, Zotac, and even the Aorus Master.  First, its mounting plate and heatsink are very well engineered.  It is much better than the flimsily designed Zotac and EVGA card interface. There is a lower chance of card sagging when it mounts horizontally or vertically.  It is clearly designed for overclocking enthusiasts as both VRM's and heatsink designs are clearly geared toward extreme performance.  Do make sure that you have at least two (if not three) 8-pin cables (150 Watts each) and PCI-E (75 Watts) connections at minimum in order to run this card properly.I have used many RTX 3080 12G cards from various third-party vendors.  This card replaces the Aorus Master as my favorite from the perspective of performance and ergonomic.  If I had to pick just one card for this generation of RTX 3080 12G at $800 USD, this would be the one.  Of course, personal tastes and preferences prevail; still, in my humble opinion, the Strix Card is the best offering on Amazon.com, of course, excluding the entire class of water cooled graphic cards.  Keep in mind that I have yet to see a single RTX 3080 or 3090 card that adequately performs in VR.  Glitches in the refresh rate recur despite multiple attempts to resolve this problem with different game drivers among many cards on many board producers across 5 different GPUs.  In short, do not update for your VR needs as the GTX1080 Ti performs much better compared to the glitchy RTX 3000 cards.  NVidia needs to step up to fix this problem, and no new cards, not even with the RTX 4000 cards, should ever again be recommended for VR use until adequate quality control has been effectively implemented by NVidia.","8":"Despu\u00e9s de varias semanas, todo funciona sin problemas, cumple las expectativas.","9":"Great performance. Very noisy under full load But temperature are OK","10":"The card is amazing. My motherboard was really old and rams as well as my cpu. I have to replace those things to fully benefit from the GPU. I don\u2019t have money right now. So I returned it for that reason. And also because of coil whine noise from this GPU. I wanted to keep it for next year when I build a new P.C but new GPU around the corner so that\u2019s probably not the smartest choice right now.","11":"Great card, really loud coil wine tho. Also, I recommend using OpenRGB instead of Armory crate to mess with the RGB on this thing because ASUS's Armory Crate program is garbage.","12":"It is a typical solidly made ASUS Strix product. Fans can get a bit noisy running a fully loaded RTX program, especially if I have HDR tuned on. It does smooth out the motion in videos and games significantly over my old 3060.  I recommend this to anyone running a 3060 or older card to increase the video smoothness in all uses.","13":"If you have an ASUS Motherboard or use ICUE to manage your RGB this is the card to get. 75 FPS Raytracing High 1440p in Cyberpunk 2077, Absolutely demolished my 3070. Runs quiet and cool. 200 FPS in Doom 2016 at 1440p max settings. For $800 this card is the 3080 to get. To me the 3080ti is not worth the extra cost. If you are aming to max everything in 4K though and get 60FPS + , 3090 ti is the next step up","14":"Point of disclosure that I did not purchase this on Amazon, but I did find it on sale at another Big Box store, although I do write a lot of reviews for products purchased on Amazon proper. (Apologies to Amazon.). This is NOT a paid endorsement.With the recent drop in Nvidia pricing, you would be hard pressed to find a more capable graphics card for the money. This particular ASUS Strix 3080 12 Gb OC graphics card is high performance right out of the box. It has superior VRM circuitry, heat sinks, and high power limits for overclocking an already overclocked card. In running Unigine Superposition, (1080p Extreme) this card's results ranked higher then a lot of RTX 3080 Ti models, and even a lot of RTX 3090 Video Cards, and this card is less expensive than those models. That is value. As to my rig, I did not notice any coil whine as some reviewers have noted, but this can be due to Power supply issues as well.While the ASUS Strix 3080 12 Gb video card runs fairly cool due to the massive and well designed heat sinks, it will put out a lot of heat into your computer case. A lot of heat. If you are running an air cooled CPU cooler, you will probably notice your CPU temperatures going up during Gaming or rendering.As to power supplies, please keep in mind that this is not a generic RTX 3080. The RTX 3080 12 Gb draws a lot more power and even more power than the RTX 3080 Ti. This video card is designed to pull more then 400 Watts. With the noted power draw spikes on 3000 series Nvidia video cards and an oveclocked CPU, a superior 850 Watt power supply probably will not cut it. If you notice games dropping out or other strange computer glitches where you had none before, make sure your power supply is adequate.One other thing to keep in mind is that this Video card is very large, and you really do need to check your case dimensions to ensure a fit. The card looks like the deck of an aircraft carrier sitting in my windowed Computer case. One nice thing is that the card is very rigid and I do not notice any sagging due to weight. It is still not a bad idea to have additional support though.Last, if you are into RGB control, the ASUS Strix works great with the ASUS Aura software, which is saying a lot. There are some other brands out there where the RGB software simply does not work. They know who they are.In short, I am very glad that I made this purchase for both the value and the investment. Overall, I have found the ASUS Strix video cards to be excellent, and I have not had one fail on me thus far.  (Knock on Wood). Happy Gaming or Rendering or Video Editing!","15":"..and I'm fine with this price. The card is a power house... and it is a space heater too. Zero issues with drivers, no crashes.","16":"This is everything one could hope for in a GPU (12gb gddr6x ram) awesome clock speeds, 3 fan cooler.It games well, stays very cool while running AAA titles on ultimate\/high graphics settings with ray tracing. It gets a little noisy but noise is fine if they card is staying cool.It's an absolute monster, enormous card, 3-slot GPU (though only need to remove 2 pci-e external access panels).One more important note this card requires 3 x 8pin ATX power connection. So a standard 8pin to dual 8pin and another 8pin to 8pin works just fine. And it runs fine on my EVGA G3 750w Platinum Plus PSU","17":"Amazing card.  Plays everything that I throw at it above and beyond.","18":"Muy buena para juegos demandantes, y por el precio es la mejor de la serie 3000 para jugar a m\u00e1s de 165Hz a 1440p","19":"Have to undervolt and cap FPS to make the coil whine tolerable","20":"Strix cards are terrible when it comes to coil whine. Absolutely unbearable. Get something else."},"StarRating":{"0":1,"1":5,"2":4,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":2,"7":4,"8":5,"9":3,"10":5,"11":5,"12":5,"13":5,"14":5,"15":5,"16":5,"17":5,"18":5,"19":3,"20":1},"Date":{"0":"2022-04-13","1":"2022-05-12","2":"2022-05-18","3":"2022-07-21","4":"2022-07-26","5":"2022-07-30","6":"2022-08-10","7":"2022-08-17","8":"2022-08-20","9":"2022-08-21","10":"2022-08-22","11":"2022-08-26","12":"2022-08-28","13":"2022-09-01","14":"2022-09-05","15":"2022-09-08","16":"2022-09-14","17":"2022-09-15","18":"2022-09-15","19":"2022-09-18","20":"2022-09-22"},"Sentiment":{"0":-0.3612,"1":0.0,"2":0.4466,"3":0.6369,"4":0.6369,"5":0.6249,"6":-0.4767,"7":0.6369,"8":0.0,"9":-0.3612,"10":-0.7935,"11":-0.1901,"12":0.7096,"13":0.0,"14":0.7125,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":-0.7184,"20":0.1531},"avgSentiment":{"0":-0.3612,"1":-0.1806,"2":0.0284666667,"3":0.180575,"4":0.27184,"5":0.3306833333,"6":0.2153428571,"7":0.2680375,"8":0.2382555556,"9":0.17831,"10":0.0899636364,"11":0.066625,"12":0.1160846154,"13":0.1077928571,"14":0.1481066667,"15":0.13885,"16":0.1306823529,"17":0.1234222222,"18":0.1169263158,"19":0.07516,"20":0.0788714286},"avgStars":{"0":1.0,"1":3.0,"2":3.3333333333,"3":3.75,"4":4.0,"5":4.1666666667,"6":3.8571428571,"7":3.875,"8":4.0,"9":3.9,"10":4.0,"11":4.0833333333,"12":4.1538461538,"13":4.2142857143,"14":4.2666666667,"15":4.3125,"16":4.3529411765,"17":4.3888888889,"18":4.4210526316,"19":4.35,"20":4.1904761905}}
